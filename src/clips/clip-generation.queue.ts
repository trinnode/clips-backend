 *                  Clip jobs can take up to 30 min — set to 35 min with a
 *                  comfortable buffer.
 *
 * stalledInterval: How often (ms) the stall-checker runs to find jobs whose
 *                  lock has not been renewed (worker crashed mid-job).
 *                  Set to 60 s so stalled jobs are recovered within a minute
 *                  after an unexpected process death.
 *
 * maxStalledCount: How many times a job may be stall-recovered before it is
 *                  moved to `failed` permanently.  Prevents infinite recovery
 *                  loops on poison-pill jobs.
